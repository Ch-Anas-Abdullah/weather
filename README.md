# Flutter Weather App

Welcome to my Flutter Weather App project! This is one of my early learning projects, where I've built a weather application using Flutter, the GetX state management library, and the AccuWeather API.

## Project Overview

This Flutter app allows you to check the current weather conditions, as well as the forecast, for any location you choose. It provides real-time weather data and a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Real-time weather data retrieval from AccuWeather API.
- Location-based weather information.
- Current weather conditions and multi-day forecast.
- Intuitive and responsive user interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: For building the cross-platform mobile application.
- **GetX**: For state management and navigation.
- **AccuWeather API**: For fetching accurate weather data.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your system.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the project dependencies.
4. Replace your AccuWeather API key in the `lib/api/api_key.dart` file.
5. Run `flutter run` to start the application.

## Configuration

Before running the app, you need to obtain an API key from AccuWeather and replace it in the `api_constants.dart` file. You can sign up for a free API key on the [AccuWeather Developer Portal](https://developer.accuweather.com/).

## Usage

- Launch the app and select a location to view its weather information.
- Explore current weather conditions and forecasts for the selected location.
